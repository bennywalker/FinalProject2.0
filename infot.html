    <h1><b>INFOTC 1000 and INFOTC 1040</b></h1>
    <h2>The Final Projects</h2>
    <p>I decided to combine both of my INFOTC classes into 1 page.</p>

    <h3>INFOTC 1000</h3>
    <p>My final project for INFOTC 1000 is this project. This is pretty meta.</p>

    <h3>INFOTC 1040</h3>
    <p>My final profect for INFOTC 1040 is pretty cool. It essentially requries me to write code that collects data from a file and organizes the information. This project makes me feel like im going to Wall Street.</p>
